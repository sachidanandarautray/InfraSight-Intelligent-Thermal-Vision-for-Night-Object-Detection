# InfraSight-Intelligent-Thermal-Vision-for-Night-Object-Detection


#### Overview:
InfraVision is a cutting-edge project designed to leverage the power of deep learning and thermal imaging to detect objects in complete darkness or low-light environments. By combining the capabilities of thermal cameras with the YOLOv5 object detection model, this project provides a robust solution for applications requiring enhanced visibility, such as night-time navigation, rescue operations, and security monitoring.
